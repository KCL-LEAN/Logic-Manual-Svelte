         This section will discuss the semantics of Propositional Logic, following Chapter 5 of the Logic Manual.

        First, a small warning: please do not consider the first 6 lines of the code editor, this is just LEAN background functioning. 
        Semantic structures assign truth values to sentences in the language. We construct here a toy model and declare sentences A, C as true and B, D as false.
        Now following the definition of satisfaction (Def 5.2) you can evaluate the truth value of compound sentences. 
        Instead of truth tables, LEAN automatically completes this interpretation. If you click over the #eval statements, you should be able to see 'true' or 'false'. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Test your own examples here! You can define your own assigments and evaluate more complex expression.
