    Propositional Logic in LEAN

       <p>
        In the introduction, we learned how to write compound sentences in LEAN. This section will discuss the semantics of Propositional Logic, following Chapter 5 of the Logic Manual.

        First, a small warning: please do not consider the first 6 lines of the code editor, this is just LEAN background functioning. 
        You already will have seen that a semantic structure assigns truth values to sentences in the language. 
        We do this here for a toy model by hand and declare sentences A, C as true and B, D as false. Now following the definition of satisfaction (Def 5.2) you can evaluate the truth value of compound expressions. 
        This is typically done via truth tables, where you identify the central connective and then deduce whether the expression is true or false based on its componenets. 
        Now LEAN does this automatically for you. If you hover over the #eval statements, then you should be able to see 'true' or 'false'. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Test your own examples, you define your own assigments and truth values and evaluate more complex expression. This is a good place to learn to type and use all connectives in LEAN and familiarise yourself. 
        </p>
        In the next few sections, we will look at the natural deduction rules for propositional logic. We look at the introduction and elimination rules for each connective separately and learn their implementation in LEAN.
        This will allow you do natural deduction proofs in LEAN and have them be checked automatically, similarly to the expressions we saw here.
