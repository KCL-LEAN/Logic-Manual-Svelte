<h3> Conditional</h3>
<p> The rules for the Conditional are the following: 
    $\infer[\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow B} {\infer*{B}{[A]}}$ 
    $\infer[Elim]{B} {A\rightarrow B& A}$ </p>
<p> With the introduction of the conditional, you discharge the assumption of the antecedent, A in this case. 
    The discharged assumption is indicated by the square brackets [ ].
    In LEAN the rules function very similar. 
    The Elimination is easier: Given two assumptions $(h1: A \rightarrow B)$ and $(h2: A)$ you get $B$
    simply by writing $h1$ $h2$ consecutively (see the example in the code). 
    The introduction of the conditional is more complex, as we need to remove an assumption. This works in LEAN via a so called lambda function, where we define $fun$ $h:$ Antecedent $=> $ Consequent. 
    The $h:$ stands for hypothesis, you designate the Antecedent as an hypothesis.  You can define more complex statements in the antecedent and consequent as well. </p>
<p>
    Here are three examples of natural deduction proofs involving the rules for the conditional. 
    There are more example so that the functioning of the $fun$ tactic becomes clear.
    Example 1: $A \rightarrow B, B\rightarrow C, A \vdash C$
    \[\infer[\rightarrow Elim]{C}{B\rightarrow C &\infer[\rightarrow Elim]{B}{A\rightarrow B & A}}\]
    Example 2: $\vdash A \rightarrow A \land A$
    \[\infer[\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow A \land A}{\infer[\land Intro]{A\land A}{\infer{A}{[A]} & \infer{A}{[A]}}}\]
    Example 3: $A\rightarrow B, B\rightarrow C \vdash A \rightarrow C$
    \[\infer[\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow C}{\infer[\rightarrow Elim] {C}{B \rightarrow C & \infer [\rightarrow Elim]{B} {A\rightarrow B & [A]}}}\]
