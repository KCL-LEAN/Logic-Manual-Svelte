          <h1> Introduction To Using Lean </h1>
          <p> This section gives you the fundamental background to using LEAN. We introduce the LEAN syntax so that you can write the logical connectives.  
              This will be particularly helpful in the next sections, where we go through the introduction and elimination rules of each connective. You will be able to verify your reasoning directly, being guided by the LEAN editor. </p>
          <p> LEAN is an automated theorem prover- so if you input your deduction, it will show you errors and lead you to the correct path. 
              We will familiarise ourselves with the basic reasoning in propositional logic, but LEAN is much more powerful. It is used for example at Imperial College by Kevin Buzzard to teach undergraduate mathematics. The tool helps to construct and verify proofs of difficult constructions.
              With this resource, you can familiarise yourself with the basics of the LEAN and learn logical deductions using a different approach. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You will have already seen the LEAN editor at the sidebar, this is where you can write LEAN. In this main page, we will do the basic introductions and you can directly test it in the editor. There will always be extra exerises to try on your own. But before, we need to learn the syntax of LEAN. 
            How can you write the connective in the programming language? See the table below for instructions:

    You may have noticed the following line at the top of the LEAN editor window:
        <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #fabd4e; font-weight: bold">variable</span>(A B C D: Prop)
        </pre></div>
    It specifies propositions in the language. In the Logic Manual, Halbach calls these sentence letters. Now a proposition is a sentence when has a truth value. 
    A semantic structure assigns a truth value to exactly every sentence letter of the language. Hence, we can understand the sentence letters as proposition here. The semantics of propositional logic are the discussed more in detail in the next section.
    <p>
    By definition 2.2 in the Logic Manual, we know for sentence letters A,B that binary connectives $\land, \lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$ applied to sentence letters also produces sentences $A\land B, A\lor B, A\rightarrow B, A \leftrightarrow B$.
    Similarly, for a sentence A and negation, $\neg A$ is also a sentence.
    You can confirm this by hovering over the statements in the code editor. We defined A, B as propositions and hence if we check the expressions such as $A\land B$, LEAN will give that these are also propositions.
    We look at the semantics in the next section.
