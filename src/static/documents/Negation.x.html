<h2> Negation</h2>
        <p>
            The rules for negation in propositional logic are the following:  
            $$\infer{\neg Intro} {\neg P} { {\underset{Q}{\overset{[P]}{\vdots}} &  {\underset{\neg Q}{\overset{[P]}{\vdots}}}}}$$  $$\infer{\neg Elim } { P}  {\underset{Q}{\overset{[\neg P]}{\vdots}} &  {\underset{\neg Q}{\overset{[\neg P]}{\vdots}}}}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works differently in LEAN. Negation $\neg P$ is here defined as $P \rightarrow \bot$, where $\bot$ is a contradiction such as $ 0\neq 0 $ for example.
            There are two main tactics for negation in LEAN. The first one is similar to negation introduction. If you want to prove $\neg P$ then you assume $P$ and show that it leads to a contradiction. 
            This assumption is constructed similarly to the conditional and disjunctive rules using <i>fun</i>. Under some assumption you proof a contradiction (a False in LEAN). Then you get the desired result $\neg P$. It is written as follows:
            <h4>fun h: P +=> show False from $\neg Q \quad Q$</h4>
           
            Note that the order matters here, to show False from $Q$ and $\neg Q$, you must state the negated statement first. 
            
        </p>
        <p></p>
            The second tactic involving negation used in LEAN is the so called Ex falso quodlibet principle that anything can be derived from a contradiction. In LEAN this is done by the tactic: <i>absurd</i>. 
            Suppose you are given some contradictory assumptions such as h1: $ P$ and h2: $\neg P$. Then you can prove any claim $Q$ simply by stating 
            <h4 style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #fabd4e; font-weight: bold">absurd</span> h2 h1
            </pre></h4>
            Again here the order matters, the negated statement must come first.

            Let's look at some example derivations. Again, you can find more exercises in the editor.

            Example 1: $P\rightarrow Q, \neg Q\vdash \neg P$
            $$\infer{\neg Intro}{\neg P}{\infer{\rightarrow Elim}{Q}{P\rightarrow Q & [P]} & \neg Q}$$
            
        
            Example 2: $P\land Q, \neg P\vdash R$
            $$\infer=[  ]{R}{\infer{\land Elim}{P}{P\land Q}&\neg P}$$
