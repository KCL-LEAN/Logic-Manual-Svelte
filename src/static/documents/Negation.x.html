<h3> Negation</h3>
        <p>
            The rules for negation are the following: 
            \newline $$\infer{\neg Intro} {\neg A} {\infer*{B}{{A}} & \infer*{\neg B}{{A}}}$$  $$\infer{\neg Elim } { A} infer*{B}{{neg A}} & infer*{neg B}{{neg A}}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works a little bit differently in LEAN. Negation $\neg A$ is here defined as $A \rightarrow \bot$, where $\bot$ is a contradiction such as $0\not=0$ for example.
            There are two main tactics with respect to negations in LEAN. The first one is some sort of negation introduction. If you want to prove $\neg A$ then you assume $A$ and show that it leads to a contradiction. 
            This assumption is constructed similarly to the conditional and disjunctive rules above. So given that you want to prove $\neg A$ from the assumption  $h1:$ $\neg A$, then you get the result from
            <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #fabd4e; font-weight: bold">assume</span> h: A, show False from h1 h
            </pre></div> 
            Here $h1 $ $ h$, which are defined as $\neg A$ $A$ respectively, gives the False. Note that the order matters here, the negated statement must come first.  \\
            The second tactic involving negation is the often so called Ex falso quodlibet principle, which states that anything can be derived from a contradiction. In LEAN this is done by the tactic absurd. 
            So suppose you are given some contradictory assumptions such as $h1: $ $ A$ and $h2: $ $\neg A$. Then you can prove $B$ simply by stating 
            <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #fabd4e; font-weight: bold">absurd</span> h2 h1
            </pre></div> 
            Again here the order matters.

            Let's look at some example derivations both in propositional logic and LEAN. 
            Example 1: $A\rightarrow B, \neg B\vdash \neg A$
            \[\infer[\neg Intro]{\neg A}{\infer{B}{A\rightarrow B & [A]} & \neg B}\]
            Example 2: $A\land B, \neg A\vdash C$
            \[\infer{C}{\infer[\land Elim]{A}{A\land B}&\neg A}\]
