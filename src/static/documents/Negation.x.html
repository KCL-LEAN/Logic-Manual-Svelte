<h2> Negation</h2>
        <p>
            The rules for negation in propositional logic are well known to you.  
            $$\infer{\neg Intro} {\neg A} { {\underset{B}{\overset{[A]}{\vdots}} &  {\underset{\neg B}{\overset{[A]}{\vdots}}}}}$$  $$\infer{\neg Elim } { A}  {\underset{B}{\overset{[\neg A]}{\vdots}} &  {\underset{\neg B}{\overset{[\neg A]}{\vdots}}}}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works differently in LEAN. Negation $\neg A$ is here defined as $A \rightarrow \bot$, where $\bot$ is a contradiction such as $ 0\neq 0 $ for example.
            There are two main tactics for negation in LEAN. The first one is similar to negation introduction. If you want to prove $\neg A$ then you assume $A$ and show that it leads to a contradiction. 
            This assumption is constructed similarly to the conditional and disjunctive rules above. So under some assumption you proof a contradiction (a False in LEAN). Then you get the desired result $\neg A$. It is written as follows:
            <h4>fun h A +=> show False from $\neg B \quad B$</h4>
           
            Note that the order matters here, if you want to show False from $B$ and $\neg B$, you must state the negated statement first. 
            
        </p>
        <p></p>
            The second tactic involving negation used in LEAN is the so called Ex falso quodlibet principle that anything can be derived from a contradiction. In LEAN this is done by a new tactic: absurd. 
            So suppose you are given some contradictory assumptions such as h1: $ A$ and h2: $\neg A$. Then you can prove any claim $B$ simply by stating 
            <h4 style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #fabd4e; font-weight: bold">absurd</span> h2 h1
            </pre></h4>
            Again here the order matters.

            Let's look at some example derivations both in propositional logic and LEAN. Again, you can find more exercises in the editor. 
            Example 1: $A\rightarrow B, \neg B\vdash \neg A$
            $$\infer{\neg Intro}{\neg A}{\infer{\rightarrow Elim}{B}{A\rightarrow B & [A]} & \neg B}$$
            Example 2: $A\land B, \neg A\vdash C$
            $$\infer=[  ]{C}{\infer{\land Elim}{A}{A\land B}&\neg A}$$
        </p>
