<h1>
    Propositional Logic and Lean
    </h1>
    <div>
       <p>
        The plan for this section is to review the natural deduction rules for propositional logic and to learn their implementation in LEAN. 
        The rules of propositional logic should be familiar to you from the lectures. 
        The aim is to get to familiar with the basic LEAN syntax.
        This is best done by looking at examples and then solving exercises.
        In the coding window, every "sorry" should be removed by your deduction. 
        "Sorry" is a trick to make LEAN move on and not display an error warning.
        </p> 
    
    
    
    <h3> Conditional</h3>
        <p> The rules for the Conditional are the following: 
            $$\infer=\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow B} {\infer*{B}{[A]}}$$ 
            $$\infer=Elim]{B} {A\rightarrow B& A}$$ </p>
        <p> With the introduction of the conditional, you discharge the assumption of the antecedent, A in this case. 
            The discharged assumption is indicated by the square brackets [ ].
            In LEAN the rules function very similar. 
            The Elimination is easier: Given two assumptions $$(h1: A \rightarrow B)$$ and $$(h2: A)$$ you get $$B$$
            simply by writing $$h1$$ $$h2$$ consecutively (see the example in the code). 
            The introduction of the conditional is more complex, as we need to remove an assumption. This works in LEAN via a so called lambda function, where we define $$fun$$ $$h:$$ Antecedent $$=> $$ Consequent. 
            The $$h:$$ stands for hypothesis, you designate the Antecedent as an hypothesis.  You can define more complex statements in the antecedent and consequent as well. </p>
        <p>
            Here are three examples of natural deduction proofs involving the rules for the conditional. 
            There are more example so that the functioning of the $$fun$$ tactic becomes clear.
            Example 1: $$A \rightarrow B, B\rightarrow C, A \vdash C$$
            $$\infer=\rightarrow Elim]{C}{B\rightarrow C &\infer=\rightarrow Elim]{B}{A\rightarrow B & A}}$$
            Example 2: $$\vdash A \rightarrow A \land A$$
            $$\infer=\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow A \land A}{\infer=\land Intro]{A\land A}{\infer{A}{[A]} & \infer{A}{[A]}}}$$
            Example 3: $$A\rightarrow B, B\rightarrow C \vdash A \rightarrow C$$
            $$\infer=\rightarrow Intro]{A\rightarrow C}{\infer=\rightarrow Elim] {C}{B \rightarrow C & \infer [\rightarrow Elim]{B} {A\rightarrow B & [A]}}}$$ 
        </p>
    
    <h3>Disjunction</h3>
        <p> 
            The rules for Disjunction are the following: 
            $$\infer{\lor Intro} {A\lor B} {A}$$   $$\infer{\lor Intro} {A\lor B} {B}$$  $$\infer{\lor Elim} {C} 
            {A \lor B & \infer*{C}{{A}}& \infer*{C}{{B}}}$$
        </p>
        <p> Similarly In LEAN the rules are again very similar. For the introduction of the disjunction you can use $$Or.intro\_left$$ $$A $$ $$ B$$ to get $$A \lor B$$ or $$Or.intro\_right$$ $$A$$ $$B$$ to get $$B\lor A$$.
            Note in LEAN the order of the disjunctions matters. The rule of the Elimination is a bit more complicated. You need to show that $$C$$ follows from both $$A, B$$ independently to be able to eliminate the disjunction.
            This is done using the same tactic as above with the conditional using $$fun$$. 
            So we write $$Or.elim $$ $$ A \lor B $$ ($$fun$$ $$ h1:$$ A  $$=>$$ C)  ($$fun$$ $$ h1:$$ B  $$=>$$ C). </p>
        <p>
            Now look at an example natural deduction proof using the rules for conjunction and its implementation in LEAN. 
            Example : $$A\lor B \vdash A \lor (B \lor C)$$
            $$\infer=\lor Elim]{A\lor (B \lor C)}{A\lor B &\infer=\lor Intro]{A\lor (B\lor C)}{[A]} & \infer=\lor Intro]{A\lor (B\lor C)}{\infer=\lor Intro]{B\lor C}{[B]}}} $$
            And there are again some exercises for you to complete. 
        </p>
    
    <h3> Negation</h3>
        <p>
            The rules for negation are the following: 
            \newline $$\infer{\neg Intro} {\neg A} {\infer*{B}{{A}} & \infer*{\neg B}{{A}}}$$  $$\infer{\neg Elim } { A} infer*{B}{{neg A}} & infer*{neg B}{{neg A}}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            This works a little bit differently in LEAN. Negation $$\neg A$$ is here defined as $$A \rightarrow \bot$$, where $$\bot$$ is a contradiction such as $$0\not=0$$ for example.
            There are two main tactics with respect to negations in LEAN. The first one is some sort of negation introduction. If you want to prove $$\neg A$$ then you assume $$A$$ and show that it leads to a contradiction. 
            This assumption is constructed similarly to the conditional and disjunctive rules above. So given that you want to prove $$\neg A$$ from the assumption $$h1:$$ $$\neg A$$, then  $$fun$$ $$h:$$ $$A$$ $$=>$$ $$show$$ $$False$$ $$from$$ $$h1$$ $$h$$ gives the result. 
            Here $$h1 $$ $$ h$$, which are defined as $$\neg A$$ $$A$$ respectively, gives the False. Note that the order matters here, the negated statement must come first.  \\
            The second tactic involving negation is the often so called Ex falso quodlibet principle, which states that anything can be derived from a contradiction. In LEAN this is done by the tactic absurd. 
            So suppose you are given some contradictory assumptions such as $$h1: $$ $$ A$$ and $$h2: $$ $$\neg A$$. Then you can prove $$B$$ simply by stating $$absurd $$ $$h2$$ $$h1$$. Again here the order matters. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at some example derivations both in propositional logic and LEAN. 
            Example 1: $$A\rightarrow B, \neg B\vdash \neg A$$
            $$\infer=\neg Intro]{\neg A}{\infer{B}{A\rightarrow B & [A]} & \neg B}$$
            Example 2: $$A\land B, \neg A\vdash C$$
            $$\infer{C}{\infer=\land Elim]{A}{A\land B}&\neg A}$$
        </p>
    <h3> Combination of Rules</h3>
        <p>
            Let's look at some example natural deduction proofs combining the rules introduced above. We will discuss one example together and then there are some more exercises.  </p>
        <p>
            Example  $$A\lor (B \land C)\vdash (A\lor B) \land (A \lor C)$$
            $$\infer{\land Intro}{ (A\lor B) \land (A \lor C)} 
            {\infer{\lor Elim}{A \lor B}{A\lor (B \land C) &
            \infer{\lor Intro}{A\lor B}{A}& \infer{\lor Intro}{A\lor B}{\infer{\land Elim}{B}{B\land C}}} & 
            \infer{\lor Elim}{A\lor C}{A\lor (B \land C) & \infer{\lor Intro}{A\lor C}{A}& \infer{\lor Intro}{A\lor C}{\infer{\land Elim}{C}{B\land C}}}} $$
