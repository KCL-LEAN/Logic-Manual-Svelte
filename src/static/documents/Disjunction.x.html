<h3>Disjunction</h3>
        <p> 
            The rules for Disjunction are the following: 
            $$\infer{\lor Intro} {A\lor B} {A}$$   $$\infer{\lor Intro} {A\lor B} {B}$$  $$\infer{\lor Elim} {C} 
            {A \lor B & \infer*{C}{{A}}& \infer*{C}{{B}}}$$
        </p>
        <p> Similarly In LEAN the rules are again very similar. For the introduction of the disjunction you can use $Or.intro\_left$ $A $ $ B$ to get $A \lor B$ or $Or.intro\_right$ $A$ $B$ to get $B\lor A$.
            Note in LEAN the order of the disjunctions matters. The rule of the Elimination is a bit more complicated. You need to show that $C$ follows from both $A, B$ independently to be able to eliminate the disjunction.
            This is done using the same tactic as above with the conditional using $fun$. 
            So we write $Or.elim $ $ A \lor B $ ($fun$ $ h1:$ A  $=>$ C)  ($fun$ $ h1:$ B  $=>$ C). </p>
        <p>
            Now look at an example natural deduction proof using the rules for conjunction and its implementation in LEAN. 
            Example : $A\lor B \vdash A \lor (B \lor C)$
            \[\infer[\lor Elim]{A\lor (B \lor C)}{A\lor B &\infer[\lor Intro]{A\lor (B\lor C)}{[A]} & \infer[\lor Intro]{A\lor (B\lor C)}{\infer[\lor Intro]{B\lor C}{[B]}}} \]
            And there are again some exercises for you to complete.
